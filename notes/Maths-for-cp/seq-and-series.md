ap =  common difference  

a = t1

d = t2- t1 

a,a+d,a+2d,...

avg = summ / n

summ = avg * n

summ of ap = a+l//2 

nth term = a + (n-1) * d 




gp = common ratio

a,ar,ar^2,..

r = ar/a 

n term  = a*r power(n-1)

summ of gp = a(r^n-1)/ (r-1) if r>1 or 1-r 

summ of infinite series = a/(1-r)


summ of n natural numbers = n*(n+1)//2 

summ of n -square natural numbers  = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)//2 

summ of n - cube natural numbers  = [n*(n+1)//2]**2 


hp = iniverse of AP

mod(x) = x if x>0  or x<0 [positive value of x]
